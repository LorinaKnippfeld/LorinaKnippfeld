# Nice to meet you, I'm Lorina <img vertical-align="sub" alt="image: Flaticon.com'" width="66px" height="55px" src="assets/Loricat_small.png">

I'm a recent graduate from SPICED Academy's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This is a 12 week full-time bootcamp focused on JS.  
At the moment I am looking for a possibility to learn fast, strengthen my JavaScript skills and contribute to a motivated team.\
Prior I was a project manager in the tourism industry, and lately I discovered a passion for design. Currently I work for CM4All in Cologne.
